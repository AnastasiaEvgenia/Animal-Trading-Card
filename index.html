			<p>Asher is a black cat with gorgeous, huge eyes. He lives in our house
				 with his best friend Korra, our second cat. He loves running around and
				 destroying our house with her. His favorite place to sleep is under
				 my sheets. He prefers to be cuddled when he is sleepy or when
			   he is about to eat. Everyone who touches his tail will have to deal with
			   his claws of wrath!!!
